# 🧠 Parkinson's Voice Detection using Machine Learning

A complete Python pipeline to detect Parkinson's disease from voice recordings. This project extracts acoustic features from audio files, trains and compares multiple machine learning models, and provides a simple interface to predict the condition from new voice samples.

---

## ✨ Key Features

-   **Acoustic Feature Extraction**: Automatically extracts 12 key vocal biomarkers (Jitter, Shimmer, HNR) from `.wav` files using the powerful `parselmouth` library, which interfaces with the Praat acoustic analysis software.
-   **Automated ML Pipeline**: A streamlined process that includes:
    -   Data preprocessing and feature generation.
    -   Imputation of missing feature values.
    -   Feature scaling for optimal model performance.
-   **Model Comparison**: Trains, evaluates, and compares three robust classification models:
    -   **Random Forest**
    -   **XGBoost**
    -   **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
-   **Best Model Selection**: Automatically identifies and saves the best-performing model based on test accuracy.
-   **Ready-to-Use Prediction**: Includes a function to easily load the saved model and predict the status (Healthy or Parkinson's) of a new, unseen audio sample.

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project environment.

### 1. Prerequisites: Praat

This project depends on `parselmouth`, which requires the **Praat** software. While you don't need to install Praat separately on most systems (as `parselmouth` often bundles it), if you encounter issues, you can download it from [praat.org](https://www.praat.org/).

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Anandbala10/parkinsons-voice-detection.git](https://github.com/Anandbala10/parkinsons-voice-detection.git)
cd parkinsons-voice-detection
3. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
Bash
```

# For Windows
```
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
4. Install Dependencies
Install all the required Python libraries using the following command:

Bash
```
pip install pandas parselmouth-praat numpy scikit-learn xgboost
```
📁 Dataset Setup
The script is designed to work with a specific folder structure for the audio data.

Create two folders in the root of the project directory:

PD_AH: This folder will contain the .wav voice recordings of individuals with Parkinson's Disease.

HC_AH: This folder will contain the .wav voice recordings of Healthy Controls.

Place your .wav files (preferably sustained vowel phonations like "ahhh") into the corresponding folders.

The project structure should look like this:
```
parkinsons-voice-detection/
├── PD_AH/
│   ├── pd_sample_1.wav
│   └── pd_sample_2.wav
├── HC_AH/
│   ├── hc_sample_1.wav
│   └── hc_sample_2.wav
├── your_script_name.py
└── ... (other files)
```
🚀 How to Run the Project
The entire process, from feature extraction to model saving, is automated.

Step 1: Run the Main Script
Execute the script from your terminal.

Bash

``` python feature_EX_park.py ```
Step 2: Understand the Output
The script will perform the following actions and print the progress:

Feature Extraction: It will process all audio files in the PD_AH and HC_AH folders and save the extracted features into a file named parkinsons_voice_features.csv.

Model Training: It will load the CSV, preprocess the data, and train the Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM models.

Evaluation: It will display a detailed performance comparison, including accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports for each model.

Save Best Model: The best-performing model, along with the necessary scaler and imputer, will be saved to best_parkinsons_model.pkl.

Step 3: Predict on a New Audio File
To predict whether a new voice sample indicates Parkinson's, use the predict_new_sample() function.

Place your new audio file (e.g., test_audio.wav) in the root directory.

You can either uncomment the example line at the end of the main script or create a new Python file (predict.py) with the following content:

``` predict.py ```

Python
```
# Import the function from your main script
from your_script_name import predict_new_sample

# Define the path to your new audio file
audio_file_path = 'test_audio.wav'

# Get the prediction
prediction = predict_new_sample(audio_file_path, model_file='best_parkinsons_model.pkl')

if prediction is not None:
    print(f"\nFinal Diagnosis for {audio_file_path}: {'Parkinson\'s' if prediction == 1 else 'Healthy'}")
```
Run the prediction script:

Bash

python predict.py
The output will show the extracted features, the model's confidence, and the final prediction.

🔬 Technical Details
Features Extracted
The model is trained on 12 standard acoustic features related to voice disorders:

Jitter: Measures the cycle-to-cycle variation in fundamental frequency.

jitter_local, jitter_abs, jitter_RAP, jitter_PPQ, jitter_DDP

Shimmer: Measures the cycle-to-cycle variation in amplitude.

shimmer_local, shimmer_dB, shimmer_APQ3, shimmer_APQ5, shimmer_APQ11, shimmer_DDA

Harmonics-to-Noise Ratio (HNR): Measures the ratio of harmonic sound to noise in the voice.

Models Compared
Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble model using multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and control over-fitting.

XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting): A powerful and efficient gradient boosting framework known for its high performance.

Support Vector Machine (SVM): A robust classifier that finds an optimal hyperplane to separate classes in the feature space.
